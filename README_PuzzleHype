If you cannot boot
RAMDISK SIZE
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM_COUNT=2
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM_SIZE=2097152 // 2G

- Don't upload copy_patch_to_desktop_dropbox.sh (echo5 will not be able to apply)





Disable KPTI
CONFIG_PAGE_TABLE_ISOLATION=n

Intel MPX Diasable (Intel® Memory Protection Extensions (Intel® MPX))
When MPX is enable, remote cannot malloc/calloc memory. The address will be GROWNDOWN and thus DSM cannot handle.


[kernel config]
Problem 1: when moving from echo to mir. During bootup, remote node invokes hypercall (VM_EXIT -> handle_vmcall())
Solution 1:
Disable CONFIG_PARAVIRT_SPINLOCKS
	mir originally CONFIG_PARAVIRT_SPINLOCKS=y
	echo CONFIG_PARAVIRT_SPINLOCKS=n
	so I disable CONFIG_PARAVIRT_SPINLOCKS on mir as well
and
Enable
CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE=y
CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE_DETECT_PRIMARY=y
CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE_ROTATION=y
and
Disable CONFIG_X86_DEBUG_FPU
One of these above makes hypercall

For our convinience, we init a few things only on vcpu0 in the guest kernel.
Search "pophype_set_cpu0" for the things.
